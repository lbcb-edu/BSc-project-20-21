	Usage:
	   ./pink_mapper [PATH] [PATH] [OPTION k|w|f]...
	   ./pink_mapper [PATH] [PATH] -a [OPTION m|n|g]...
	   ./pink_mapper [OPTION h|v]

	   Accepts two FASTA or FASTQ files, finds minimizers in both files and outpus number of distincitve minimizers, fractions of singletons
	   and the number of occurences of the most frequent minimzer when the top f frequent minimizers are not taken into the account.
	   The first file is a refrence genome in FASTA format,
	   while the second file is a set of fragments in either FASTA or FASTQ format.
	   Additionally, it outpouts basic statistics on given fasta/fastq files.
	   Basic statistics include:
	   	-names of sequences in the reference file and their lengths
	   	-number of sequences in the fragments file, their average length, N50 length, minimal and maximal length
	   Optionally, it picks two random fragment sequences with lengths not exceeding 5000 and aligns them.
	   

	Options:
	   -v --version                    = Print version number and exit
	   -h --help                       = Display this information and exit
	   -a <alignment_type>    	   = global, local or semiglobal
	   -m <match>              	   = match cost
	   -n <mismatch>		   = mismatch cost
	   -g <gap>			   = gap cost
	   -k <kmer_length>		   = kmer length
	   -w <window_length>		   = window length
