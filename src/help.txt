	Usage:
	   ./pink_mapper [PATH] [PATH]
	   ./pink_mapper [PATH] [PATH] -a [OPTION m|n|g]...
	   ./pink_mapper [OPTION h|v]

	   Accepts two FASTA or FASTQ files and outpus basic statistics.
	   The first file is a refrence genome in FASTA format,
	   while the second file is a set of fragments in either FASTA or FASTQ format.
	   Basic statistic include:
	   	-names of sequences in the reference file and their lengths
	   	-number of sequences in the fragments file, their average length, N50 length, minimal and maximal length
	   Optionally, it picks two random fragment sequences with lengths not exceeding 5000 and aligns them.
	   

	Options:
	   -v --version                   = Print version number and exit
	   -h --help                      = Display this information and exit
	   -a <alignment_type>    	   = global, local or semiglobal
	   -m <match>              	   = match cost
	   -n <mismatch>		   = mismatch cost
	   -g <gap>			   = gap cost
